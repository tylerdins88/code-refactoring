# Horiseon Marketing Agency Webpage Refactor

## Description

I was tasked with refactoring code to make it easier to read for the general population. I went into the "index.html" file and edited it to show semantic elements. This will allow a user to read the file more precisely. 



The original css file was very repetive. I updated it to be more minimal. The first screenshot shows a photo of original code. Followed by the second screenshot of some simplification. I was able to remove roughly 10 lines by simplifying the code.
